I can build a single page app on MEAN technologies

Content
The index page will show all workouts by all users
if you click a specific workout the show page will be a separate view with a rating and comments
a user can rate a workout on a 5 star scale and write a comment

Workout Form
Time goal of workout
give example text ("Dumbell incline press 10 reps - 35 lbs - 4 sets - rest 30 sec")
individual exercises
explanation field 

User panel 
personal fitness goal
I can visit a workout I previously put online and fill out how I actually did
I can rate from too no sweat , some sweat , at my limit , pushed my limit , upchucked on a five point scale 

Viewing workout 
I can see the exercises of the workout 
I can rate this workout (if I did it myself for example)
I can write a comment about where I think it can be improved
I can see how the user felt about previous workouts (display 3 but I can click for all maybe in pagination)

Style
All text will be center
use bootstrap css
gold stars on rating system
prefer each work out to pop up as a modal
